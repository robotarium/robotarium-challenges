# robotarium-challenges
A repository for all the Robotarium challenge problems!

# Aerospace Hackathon

This repository contains the files for the Robotarium challenge problem for the 2016 Aerospace hackathon! 

# High-level Informatoin 

At a high-level, you copy and modify the main.m file (the name doesn't matter) then submit it on the website (http://www.robotarium.org).  The server will load the required files, initialize your robot, then give you feedback on how well you completed the challenge.

# What You Have to Do 

The run_aero_challenge scripts are what the sever will run to execute your main script.  You shouldn't modify these files.  You don't need to submit them on the website, only submit your main file, but your script won't work if you do.  We will load the requisite environment files to run your script.  

1.  Run an environment.m file to load in the obstacles 
2.  Initialize your robot to the start position
3.  Drive to the goal position while avoiding obstacles
4.  Once you're happy, submit your code to the website!
